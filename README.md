## Python Socket Messenger

## Overview

This code allows for a chatroom-like communication between two (or more) individuals through a computer terminal. Unlike similar programs using sockets, it needs one file to run, regardless of the user is the server or the client. The terminal display was wrapped using the packages blessed and blessings.
